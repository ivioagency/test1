# Test 1

I've installed the theme provided to see it working there are two users create ; **test1** and **test2** ( *both same user and passwd* ) you can access with any of them.


After clone this repo, please run `docker-compose up -d` in order start *db* and *wp* containers.

For anything else, please let me know.

Best regards.


##### PD:

The theme provided weighed more than what is allowed by wordpress (2M) so, I modified the .htaccess file to allow uploading files larger
